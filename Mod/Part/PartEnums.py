    Provides information about the continuity of a curve.

    Corresponds to OCCT type GeomAbs_Shape, with the following values,

    C0: only geometric continuity.

    G1: for each point on the curve, the tangent vectors 'on the right' and 'on the left'
        are collinear with the same orientation.

    C1: continuity of the first derivative. The 'C1' curve is also 'G1' but, in addition,
        the tangent vectors 'on the right' and 'on the left' are equal.

    G2: for each point on the curve, the normalized normal vectors 'on the right' and 'on 
        the left' are equal.

    C2: continuity of the second derivative.

    C3: continuity of the third derivative.

    CN: continuity of the N-th derivative, whatever is the value given for N (infinite order
        of continuity). Also provides information about the continuity of a surface.
